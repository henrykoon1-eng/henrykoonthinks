excerpt: "A January hike that reminded me why I keep going back to the mountains."

The alarm went off at 4:30 AM and every part of me wanted to stay in bed. It was January. It was dark. The forecast said 28 degrees at the trailhead.

I went anyway.

## The Trail

The first mile is always the hardest — not because of the terrain, but because your body hasn't agreed to the plan yet. Your legs are stiff, your lungs are cold, and your mind is still running through all the reasons this was a bad idea.

But somewhere around mile two, something shifts. The rhythm of walking takes over. Your breathing steadies. The world narrows to the trail ahead and the sound of your boots on frozen ground. The mental chatter quiets, and you start to hear the mountain.

## The Ridge

I reached the ridge just as the sun was coming up. The valley below was filled with fog, and the peaks above were lit with that impossible golden light that only lasts a few minutes. I stood there, breathing hard, hands on my knees, and watched the world wake up.

There's no way to describe that moment without sounding like a greeting card. But I'll try: it felt like being forgiven. Not for anything specific — just a general absolution. The mountain didn't care about my failures or my anxieties or my to-do list. It was just there, enormous and indifferent and beautiful, and standing in its presence made everything else feel smaller.

## Why I Keep Going Back

People ask me why I hike. I never know what to say. "For the exercise" is true but incomplete. "For the views" is closer but still misses it. The real answer is something I can barely articulate: I go to the mountains because they remind me that I'm small, and that being small is okay.

In a culture that's constantly telling us to be bigger, louder, more visible, there's something deeply restful about standing on a ridge and feeling insignificant. Not worthless — insignificant. There's a difference. Worthlessness is a lie. Insignificance is a gift.

The mountains give me that gift every time I show up. All I have to do is lace up my boots and start walking.
