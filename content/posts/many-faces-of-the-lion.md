# Many Faces of the Lion

&nbsp;A Lion, roaring with power and majesty&nbsp; A good Shepherd, guiding and guarding his flock A great conqueror with sword ablaze on steed of white A benevolent king uplifting the lowly A friend to those alone and downtrodden A husband to his church A father who welcomes his lost son home He is The sun which conquers darkness daily&nbsp; The spirit who walks with us in the garden&nbsp; The very light by which we see The very calling to sacrifice more The freer of slaves, the breaker of chains The pillar of fire that guides his people The flame that does not consume The water of life itself He is our rock, our refuge our shield &nbsp;Our life and our resurrection Our strength and our hope God is truth and Beauty God is love
