The Death of Saruman

 In The Lord Of The Rings, the death of Saurman is the final victory, it is the end of the mass violence. It is so tragic because it is so unnecessary. Saruman’s scouring of the shire was horrible and hateful, yes, but in the grand realm of his capabilities it was more spiteful than Luciferian. Compared to the epic conclusion of The Lord of the Rings, the death of Saruman feels very Hobbit sized. For the Hobbits as a whole, it is a coming of age moment, they finally are given a task of their magnitude. What would once have been an impossible quest is now just the expected. But for some, the fact that such darkness is expected is sad. Here, as most everywhere in this tale, the pain is felt through Frodo. 

 Frodo feels much older than the rest of the hobbits; he is wiser, more learned and actually older, but he is also long suffered. Frodo was for a time the bearer of evil objectified, he vied against great evil without and within. He bears the external scars of the morgul blade and the internal scars of the ring. He knows corruption better than anyone, he knows who Smeagol was, he himself became Gollum. Frodo himself, at the very edge of victory, betrayed middle earth. When Frodo sees a fallen Saruman, he remembers that he too fell from grace. 

It is this great awareness of pain that makes Frodo, for a time, the unquestioned leader of the Hobbits, and the only thing he does is quite significant. This first and only action of Frodo’s kingship is the commandment to have mercy upon their enemies. 

 Frodo’s long suffering journey culminates in him becoming a leader (as such journeys are wont to do) and he remembers what Gandalf said to him in the mines of Moria, he has pity, he has mercy. In a beautiful sense, all the pain and wickedness is meant to teach forgiveness.
