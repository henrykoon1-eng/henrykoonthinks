excerpt: "A poem about the quiet beauty of winter mornings."
---

The sun arrives late in January,
slipping through bare branches
like a guest who wasn't sure
they were still invited.

It lays itself across the floor
in thin, apologetic strips —
not the bold gold of summer
but something more tentative,
more honest.

I sit in it anyway,
this pale, uncertain light,
and let it warm what it can.

There is a kind of faith
in winter mornings:
the belief that warmth exists
even when you can barely feel it,
that the sun is not gone
but only resting,
gathering itself
for the long work of spring.

I hold my coffee
and watch the light move
slowly across the room,
and I think:

*This is enough.*
*This quiet. This warmth.*
*This moment of being still*
*while the world turns*
*toward something brighter.*
