Boom i am so haopopy

dhjd d

*hahdhgd*


There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to HeavenWhen she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came forOoh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to HeavenThere's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meaningsIn a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgivenOoh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonderThere's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leavingIn my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand lookingOoh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonderAnd it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reasonAnd a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughterOh-oh-oh-oh-whoaIf there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're onAnd it makes me wonder
Ohh, whoaYour head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join himDear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to rollAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed

With a word she can get what she came for

Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure

'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder

Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the West

And my spirit is crying for leaving

In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees

And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder

Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune

Then the piper will lead us to reason

And a new day will dawn for those who stand long

And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now

It's just a spring clean for the May queen

Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run

There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Ohh, whoa

Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
