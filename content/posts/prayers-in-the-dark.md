There are seasons when prayer feels like talking into an empty room. You say the words, but they seem to hit the ceiling and fall back down. The silence on the other end isn't peaceful — it's heavy.

I've been in one of those seasons.

## Honesty Over Performance

I used to think that good prayer meant eloquent prayer. That if I could just find the right words, the right posture, the right level of sincerity, something would click. But I've come to believe that the prayers God honors most are the ones that are simply honest.

"I don't know what I'm doing."

"I'm angry and I don't know why."

"Help."

These aren't polished prayers. They're real ones. And I think there's more faith in a single honest word than in a thousand rehearsed ones.

## The Discipline of Showing Up

What I've learned is that prayer isn't about getting answers — at least not immediately. It's about maintaining a relationship. And like any relationship, it requires showing up even when it's hard, even when the other person seems distant, even when you're not sure it's working.

The discipline isn't in the words. It's in the showing up.

## What the Dark Teaches

Darkness has a way of stripping away pretense. When you can't see, you stop performing. You stop trying to impress. You just... are. And maybe that's the point. Maybe the dark seasons aren't a sign that God is absent, but an invitation to stop performing and start being present.

I'm still in the dark. But I'm still showing up. And I think that counts for something.
