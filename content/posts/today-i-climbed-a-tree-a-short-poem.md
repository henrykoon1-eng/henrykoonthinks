# Today I Climbed a Tree: A Short Poem

*Originally published on [2024-06-19](https://henrykoonthinks.blogspot.com/2024/06/today-i-climbed-tree-short-poem.html)*




*In the top of my tree on the top of a hill*

*The sun and the breeze make the night Oh so shrill*

*I dare not even sneeze I must stay quite still*

*But, I'll do as I please though a fall here would kill*

*I'll always climb trees, for play and love are God's will*
