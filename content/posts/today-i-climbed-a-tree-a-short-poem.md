# Today I Climbed a Tree: A Short Poem

*Originally published on [2024-06-19](https://henrykoonthinks.blogspot.com/2024/06/today-i-climbed-tree-short-poem.html)*

In the top of my tree on the top of a hill The sun and the breeze make the night oh so shrill I must not even sneeze I should stay quite still But, I'll do as I please though a fall here would kill I'll always climb trees, for play and love are God's will
