We live in an age that celebrates volume. Read fifty books a year. Listen to podcasts at 2x speed. Consume, consume, consume. The implicit message is clear: more is better, and faster is best.

I'd like to push back on that.

## The Case for Slowness

There's a difference between reading a book and being read by one. The first is an act of consumption. The second is an act of transformation. And transformation takes time.

When I read slowly — really slowly, a few pages at a time, with a pen in hand — something different happens. The words stop being information and start becoming experience. I argue with the author. I sit with a sentence that unsettles me. I put the book down and stare out the window, letting an idea rearrange something inside me.

## What We Lose at Speed

Speed reading is a skill. But it's a skill optimized for extraction, not encounter. When we read fast, we're mining for takeaways — bullet points we can tweet, insights we can deploy in conversation. We get the gist, but we miss the texture.

And texture is where the real nourishment lives. The rhythm of a well-crafted sentence. The way a metaphor can crack open a feeling you didn't know you had. The slow accumulation of a writer's vision, building page by page into something that changes how you see the world.

## A Modest Proposal

Read one book this month instead of four. But read it with your whole attention. Underline things. Write in the margins. Read passages aloud. Let it sit with you over days and weeks.

You'll remember it longer. You'll understand it deeper. And you might find that one book, read well, is worth more than a dozen skimmed.

The goal isn't to have read. It's to have been changed by reading.
