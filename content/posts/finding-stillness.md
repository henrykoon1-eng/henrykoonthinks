There's a kind of noise that doesn't come through speakers. It's the noise of always being available, always optimizing, always performing. It hums in the background of modern life like fluorescent lighting — you stop noticing it until someone turns it off.

I've been trying to turn it off.

## The Experiment

Last month I started leaving my phone in another room for the first hour after waking up. No alarms, no notifications, no scrolling. Just coffee, a window, and whatever my mind decided to do with the quiet.

The first few days were uncomfortable. My hand kept reaching for a device that wasn't there. But by the second week, something shifted. I started noticing things — the way morning light moves across the kitchen counter, the sound of birds I'd never paid attention to, the slow pleasure of a thought that has room to finish itself.

## What I Found

Stillness isn't the absence of activity. It's the presence of attention. When I stopped filling every gap with input, I found that my mind wasn't empty — it was full of things I'd been too distracted to hear.

Some of those things were uncomfortable. Old worries, unresolved questions, feelings I'd been outrunning. But others were gifts: ideas for writing, a sudden clarity about a relationship, a deep and surprising gratitude for ordinary things.

## The Practice

I'm not suggesting everyone throw their phone in a lake. But I am suggesting that we underestimate how much of our inner life gets drowned out by the constant stream of external stimulation.

Try it for a week. One hour of quiet in the morning. See what surfaces.

You might be surprised by what you've been missing.
