# The Calling: A Poem

*Originally published on [2024-01-29](https://henrykoonthinks.blogspot.com/2024/01/the-calling.html)*




 *The mountains are calling and I must go*

*Where breeze and brooke whisper of things I ought to know*

*Oh to be once more a humble champion upon a great peak of snow*

*Shredded to my core as the wild winds blow*

*I see clearly within myself just as the vast terrain below*

*Striding amidst such trees magnificent and unknown I again will grow*

*Forgotten is society and all of its trivial woes*

*The mountains are calling and I must go*
