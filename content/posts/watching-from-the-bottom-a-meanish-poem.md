### Watching from the Bottom: A (meanish) Poem

This is a poem dedicated to the people swarming the parking lots of our national parks, it is about those that think Yosemite or yellowstone a mere "other Disneyland". 



*I've strived all the day to reach this towering height*

*I'm giddy, even gay to ever feel such might*

*You merely drove here to say "oooh, what a sight"*

*You've earned nothing, nay your ease is your plight*

*I've earned the joy to play and to frolic with delight*

*To no surprise your clothes all too tight*

*Your focus; another tray and another bite*

*You have no way to see the light*

*Your fear bids you stay, my joy lifts like a kite*

*You chose laziness today, I'll climb another tonight*
