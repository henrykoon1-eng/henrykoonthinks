# Watching from the Bottom: A (meanish) Poem

*Originally published on [2024-06-20](https://henrykoonthinks.blogspot.com/2024/06/watching-from-bottom-meanish-poem.html)*

This is a poem dedicated to the people swarming the parking lots of our national parks, it is about those that think Yosemite or yellowstone a mere "other Disneyland".&nbsp; I've strived all the day to reach this towering height I'm giddy, even gay to ever feel such might You merely drove here to say "oooh, what a sight" You've earned nothing, nay your ease is your plight I've earned the joy to play and to frolic with delight To no surprise your clothes all too tight Your focus; another tray and another bite You have no way to see the light Your fear bids you stay, my joy lifts like a kite You chose laziness today, I'll climb another tonight
