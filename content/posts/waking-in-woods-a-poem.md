# Waking in Woods: A Poem

*Originally published on [2024-06-20](https://henrykoonthinks.blogspot.com/2024/06/waking-in-woods-poem.html)*




*To rise in the morning and breath cool fresh air*

*the smell of smoke lingering on tent, shirt and hair*

*an empty bottle of whiskey lying somewhere over there*

*To wake to a groan in the distance of cattle or of bear*

*These lovely mountains are for man to love and to share*

*Come love them yourself, even stay if you dare*
